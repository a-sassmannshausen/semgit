* Overview

  Semgit is an experiment in augmenting git commit messages with
  temporary keywords.

  This might primarily be useful in the context of needing to keep
  track of customizations of production code, to relatively easily
  prepare that code base for future upgrades.

* Installation

  To install semgit you will need Guile 2.0 or later.  At present all
  other dependencies come bundled.

  After cloning this repository you will need to update your
  GUILE_LOAD_PATH environment variable:
  $ export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=${path/to/semgit/repository}:${GUILE_LOAD_PATH}
  
  You can then add the git-sem script to your PATH, e.g. by symlinking
  it into one of your bin directories.

* Usage

  Documentation is still relatively sparse, but running
  $ git sem --help
  Should get you started.

  The basic workflow is as follows:

  $ git checkout -b $topic-branch   # Create a new topic branch
  # Carry out work...
  $ git sem tag -t                  # Tag all commits in topic branch
                                    # with "topic: $topic-branch" branchname
  $ git sem tidy                    # Remove all temporary gitsem branches.
